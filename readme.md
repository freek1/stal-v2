# STAL V2

Experiments to improve the STAL encoder, a learnable spike train encoder for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

Ideas:
- Test STAL on benchmark datasets, smartly using spatiotemporal dimensions
- Experiment with Z1 Z2 in loss or without
- Test STAL on a known good spiking architecture for a dataset
- (Make STAL a package?)

Needs improvement: 
- Make STAL (Stacked) needs to encode spikes more in spatial and temporal dimension! Maybe tweak the loss?
